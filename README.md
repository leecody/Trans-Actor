# Trans-Actor
Designing a user experience for artificial intelligence. Trans-Actor mediates computer communication through discrete nonverbal modules that facilitate conversation between a computational and human actors. 

This is just a straight dump of the code that runs the physical prototype. It is built in node, which connects to some Particle photons, python (for converting phonemes), osc (for communicating with supercollider), and the MeaningCloud API (for sentiment analysis).

All in all real messy code â€” my first node project, thrown together in a week, so don't judge me.
